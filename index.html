                <strong>History:</strong>
                The earliest written record of noodles is from a book dated to the Eastern Han period (25–220 CE).
                Noodles, often made from wheat dough, became a prominent staple of food during the Han dynasty.
                During the Song dynasty (960–1279) noodle shops were very popular in the cities, and remained open all night.
                Up until 1992, most dried Chinese noodles in the United States could not be sold labelled as "noodles".

                    <strong>Production:</strong>
                    Chinese noodles are generally made from either wheat flour, rice flour, or mung bean starch, with wheat noodles being more commonly produced and consumed in northern China and rice noodles being more typical of southern China. Egg, lye, and cereal may also be added to noodles made from wheat flour in order to give the noodles a different color or flavor. Egg whites, arrowroot or tapioca starch are sometimes added to the flour mixture in low quantities to change the texture and tenderness of the noodles' strands.
                    Before the automatic noodle machine was invented in 1950s, the processing of Chinese noodles were made with four steps, including:
                    fresh, dried, boiled, steamed.

                    <strong>Cooking:</strong>
                    Noodles may be cooked from either their fresh (moist) or dry forms. They are generally boiled, although they may also be deep-fried in oil until crispy. Boiled noodles may then be stir fried, served with sauce or other accompaniments, or served in soup, often with meat and other ingredients. Certain rice-noodles are made directly from steaming the raw rice slurry and are only consumed fresh."
